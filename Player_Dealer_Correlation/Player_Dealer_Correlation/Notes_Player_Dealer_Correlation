After looking at the data in the Dealer_schedule directories as well as the

win_loss_player_data on the date where the largest losses occored. The player

and dealer that I find to be colluding to scam Lucky Duck are Dealer Billy

Jones and the player Mylie Schmidt.

The reason why I belive that the two listed above are the individuals that

are colluding are that every time a loss occured Mylie was playing and Billy

was the dealer on the table at that time. On all of the days and times in

question this was the case.
